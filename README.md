HOW TO CHANGE BOOT ANIMATION IN SM-J8 ~vks
Any bootanimation.zip should work , just search on google or xda 

IMPORTANT, NEEDS LINEAGE 17, or any other rom , other than stock

PREPARATION:
1.Dwnload bootanimation.zip file 

2.Check the file using Boot animation changer
( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jrummy.apps.boot.animations )
a. Grant root permission
b. Install from local 
c. If it opens, play it , and make sure it is in 720p
d. if it dosent, extract your file , and the try again from step a.
e. It is possible your file was corrupt so don't sweat it
f. installing from app dosent work

3. Root explorer method will not work

4. Proceed to procedure.

PROCEDURE 
1.Samsung uses .qmg format so grab that Lineage17.gsi (tested) (or any other gsi/rom , tested on havoc too)

2.After you have successfully completed the lineage17 install

3.Grab your desired bootanimation.zip and save it somewhere accessible 

4.Boot into recovery (TWRP recommended , TESTED)

5.Mount > system , back 

6.Advanced>File manager 

7.It would be a good idea to check the bootanimation folder first 

8.System_root > system > media 

9.Rename it to bootanimation.ziplineage (anything will do )

10.Back to root directory , then navigate to your bootanimation folder and copy your file to step(8.) folder ( while copying you will not be able to see the previous zip)

11.Back to root , navigate to step(8.) Folder , rename your copied file to bootanimation.zip (important)

12.Reboot to enjoy 


Issues:
1.None , in the worst case you will not have an Bootanimation cuz you deleted it , fix it by placing a working one .

2.For the best experience use 720p files , 1080p , and 1440p files get zoomed in center .

3.No bootloop or crash encountered , so it's safe .

4. DONT DO THIS IN STOCK OS.
